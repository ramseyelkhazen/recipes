200 g unsalted butter
400 g milk chocolate
6 tablespoons golden syrup
450 g digestive biscuits, finely crushed
450 g Maltesers
200 g white chocolate
1. Melt the butter and milk chocolate together in a bowl with the golden syrup (save a tiny bit of milk chocolate for step 6)
2. Add the digestive biscuit crumbs and mix in until they are fully integrated
3. Add the maltesers (crush them a bit if you like) and mix them in too
4. Pour into a baking tray and spread out (or several baking trays if you like - sometimes I use round cake tins because I do a bit too much) 
5. Melt the white chocolate and spread it out on top (I always feel I haven't got enough white chocolate to cover the base but in the end it seems to spread out. I think I tried it once doing another 100/200g and the white chocolate layer was a bit thicker but it seemed a bit too sickly. Try it out see what you think)
6. If you have any milk chocolate left over (or dark chocolate if you like) grate it on top of the white chocolate.
7. Put in the fridge for a while (or freezer if you don't have very long but beware - if you leave it in the freezer for too long it is VERY hard to cut. I have made that mistake far too many times!)
8. Once it's set cut it into slices or bites (you don't want to make each piece too big because it is a bit too sickly in large amounts. Plus when you put them on top of each other it looks like there's more anyway)
